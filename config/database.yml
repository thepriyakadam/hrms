# # As with config/secrets.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# # like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# # ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
# #
# # Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# # the app. Read http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# # for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# # production deployment.
# #
# # On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# # available as an environment variable. For example:
# #
# #   DATABASE_URL="mysql2://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
# #
# # You can use this database configuration with:
# #
# #   production:
# #     url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
# #
# production:
#   <<: *default
#   database: hrms_production
#   username: hrms
#   password: <%= ENV['HRMS_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
